# RoadSeg
This repository implements instance segmentation of the road inside Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey, using Ultralytics YOLOv8, the latest version of the real-time object detection and image segmentation model.

Introduction

Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves identifying and segmenting individual objects within an image. In this project, we focus on segmenting the road inside Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey. Ultralytics YOLOv8 is employed for its exceptional performance in real-time object detection and image segmentation.
